## The Study Aid Assistant Project 

This project uses the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX) with a 16x2 LCD, a proximity sensor, an NFC sensor, an external NeoPixel Ring and capacitance sensing to create a shelf that aids study by concealing the user's mobile phone and allowing them to set a study timer.

## Installation
- Connect the electronic components to the CPX according to the diagram:

### Step 0
- Clone the codebase
`git clone https://github.com/elka-blitz/cs3031-group5/`

`cd cs3031-group5`

### Step 1

Move the `.py` files to the CPX

Move the `.mpy` binaries to the CPX `lib` folder

## Testing and Usage

Test operation of states. The following states should be sensed and actuated by the system via the LCD:
